# Food-delivery-time-prediction

This project involves Food delivery time prediction on a dataset based on the restaurants from India. The .ipynb file contains all the code. Extensive exploratory data analysis has been carried out on the dataset. Based on the EDA, new features have been engineered and have been chosen for training the models.
Models used:
* Xgboost
* Linear regression.
* Lasso regression.
* Ridge regression.
* Adaboost.
* Random forest.
* Decision tree regressor.
* ANN.
* SVM Regressor.


Grid search CV has been used for hyper-parameter tuning.
